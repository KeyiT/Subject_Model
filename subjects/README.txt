# This is the default root path for subjects data;

# Each subject must have a separate folder name as the subject name;
# For each model component, both bone or soft-tissue data, must have a separate folder in its subject directory. 
# e.g. subjects/SUBJECT_NAME/COMPONENT_NAME/...

# All mesh info must be saved in world coordinates; 
# Mesh file suffix can be ".ply", ".obj", ".stl", ".vtk";
# Priority: ".ply"  >  ".obj"  >  ".stl"  >  ".vtk"
# Mesh file name must follow the rule: COMPONENT_NAME + "Mesh" + SUFFIX

# All muscle attachment position must be saved in world coordinates;
# Given a rigid component, the positions of all muscle points attached to it have to be saved in a matrix form; row size must be the number of isolated attached points, column size must be 3; 
# file name must be "muscleAttachment"; this file must be saved in the directory of the corresponding subject rigid component;
